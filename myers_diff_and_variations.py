This file contains Python implementations for variations of algorithms described in 
'An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations' by EUGENE W. MYERS.  A few optimizations
not mentioned in the paper are also included here.


* FUNCTIONS INCLUDED IN THIS FILE *

  -  diff(list1, list2)  - A function to determine the minimal difference between two sequences that
     is super easy to just copy and paste when you don't actually care about all the other stuff
     in this document, and you just need to get back to work because it's already 7pm and you're still
     at the office, and you just want to get this stupid thing to work, why is there no easy answer on
     Stack Overflow that I can just copy and paste?  Oh man, I really need to stop doing this and  
     start saying no to these crazy deadlines.  I have so many friends that I need to get back to and haven't
     spoken to in a while...  Maybe I'll just stay until most of my stock options vest, and then I'll
     quit.  This function has worst-case execution time of O(min(len(a),len(b)) * D), and requires
     2 * (2 * min(len(a),len(b))) space.

  -  apply_edit_script(edit_script, s1, s2) - An example function that shows how you could make use of
     the edit script returned by 'diff' or 'shortest_edit_script' by re-constructing s2 from s1 and the
     edit script.

  -  shortest_edit_script(old_sequence, new_sequence) - A well-formatted version of the diff function
     (mentioned above) that optimizes for code clarity and readability.  This version also calls out
     to the find_middle_snake function which it depends on.  This version of the algorithm is also
     presented in a way that attempts to match the description from the paper.

  -  longest_common_subsequence(list1, list2) - A function that returns a list that is the longest
     common sub-sequence of the two input sequences.

  -  find_middle_snake_less_memory(old_sequence, N, new_sequence, M) - A variant of the 'find middle
     snake' algorithm that has more restriced bounds so the calculation doesn't go off end end of the
     edit grid.  It has worst-case execution time of min(len(a),len(b)) * D, and requires
     2 * (2 * min(len(a),len(b))) space.

  -  find_middle_snake_myers_original(old_sequence, N, new_sequence, M) - A concrete implementation of
     the algorithm discussed in Myers' paper.  This algorithm has worst-case execution time of (M + N) * D
     and requires 2 * (M + N) space.

  -  myers_diff_length_minab_memory(old_sequence, new_sequence) - A version of the basic length measuring 
     algorithm that makes use of the restriced bounds, and also allocates less memory by treating the V
     array as a circular buffer.

  -  myers_diff_length_original_page_6(old_sequence, new_sequence) - A concrete implementation of the algorithm
     discussed on page 6 of Myers' paper.

  -  myers_diff_length_optimize_y_variant(old_sequence, new_sequence) - A variant of the basic length measuring 
     algorithm that optimized for the y variable instead of x.  It is helpful to study this version when
     attempting to understand the algorithm since the choice of optimizing x or y is rather arbitrary.

  -  Various other functions are included for testing.

def find_middle_snake_myers_original(old_sequence, N, new_sequence, M):
    """
    This function is a concrete implementation of the algorithm for 'finding the middle snake' presented
    similarly to the pseudocode on page 11 of 'An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations' by EUGENE W. MYERS.
    This algorithm is a centeral part of calculating either the smallest edit script for a pair of
    sequences, or finding the longest common sub-sequence (these are known to be dual problems).

    The worst-case (and expected case) space requirement of this function is O(N + M), where N is
    the length of the first sequence, and M is the length of the second sequence.
    The worst-case run time of this function is O(MN) and this occurs when both string have no common 
    sub-sequence.  Since the expected case is for the sequences to have some similarities, the expected
    run time is O((M + N)D) where D is the number of edits required to transform sequence A into sequence B.
    The space requirement remains the same in all cases, but less space could be used with a modified version
    of the algorithm that simply specified a user-defined MAX value less than M + N.  In this case, the
    algorithm would stop earlier and report a D value no greater than MAX, which would be interpreted as
    'there is no edit sequence less than length D that produces the new_sequence from old_sequence'.

    Note that (if I have understood the paper correctly), the k values used for the reverse direction
    of this implementation have opposite sign compared with those suggested in the paper.  I found this made 
    the algorithm easier to implement as it makes the forward and reverse directions more symmetric.

    @old_sequence  This represents a sequence of something that can be compared against 'new_sequence' 
    using the '==' operator.  It could be characters, or lines of text or something different.

    @new_sequence  The new sequence to compare 'old_sequence' against.

    @M  The length of 'new_sequence'

    There are 5 return values for this function:

    The first is an integer representing the number of edits (delete or insert) that are necessary to
    produce new_sequence from old_sequence.

    The next two parts of the return value are the point (x, y) representing the starting coordinate of the
    middle snake.

    The next two return values are the point (u, v) representing the end coordinate of the middle snake.

    When testing the myers diff algorithm and its variants, it is meaningful to test by

    Randomly generating statistically independent sequences won't cover as many cases of
    program execution as 'real' sequences that have some intrinsic relationship between
    them.

    In this class, an 'edit graph' is constructed with random dimensions and filled with
    random diagonals.  The 'solve sequences' method then attempts to build two sequences
    that would have produced this edit graph as closely as possible.

    Note that it is not always possible to produce a pair of sequences that would exactly
    produce these randomly generated edit graphs because you can draw an 'impossible'
    edit graph where the implied relationship of diagonals would deduce that some squares
    that are not diagonals must in fact be diagonals.  The code below, simply solves
    for the 'equal to' constraints and ignores the 'not equal to' constraint of empty
    squares.  Therefore, the sequences that get solved for will likely not have exactly
    the same edit graph that was created, but at least it will be close and produce
    a pair of sequences with an intrinsic relationship between them.
